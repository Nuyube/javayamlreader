# javayamlreader
Javayamlreader is a very basic YAML tool that mainly focuses on breaking files down into blocks that can be processed more easily. This is not release-quality software, and is implemented for practice building a basic YAML reading tool. I strongly recommend that you search for a more useful tool.

## Including javayamlreader
